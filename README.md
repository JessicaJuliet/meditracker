## Purpose

### Introduction
With chronic illness prevalence expected to continue rising, it's important that patients are able to monitor their condition(s) and provide their medical team with a clear picture of their disease progression. In addition, the disruptions which COVID-19 has brought to the medical system, makes it's easier for new symptoms or disease progression to potentially be missed until a later point. To tackle this, MediTracker allows patients who deal with chronic illnesses to take control of their symptoms by keeping a log of their disease status over time. They can then share this log with their medical team.

### Vision and Mission
MediTracker's Vision is to empower chronic illness patients to take control of their health and its Mission is to provide patients with a secure web application which allows them to keep logs of their medical records and report it back to their medical team. 

### Target Audience
The target audience for this web application are inviduals who have chronic illnesses and want to get more from their interactions with their medical team by providing an accurate  representation of their symptoms over time, rather than recalling from memory at appointments.

## User Experience Design

### Design Inspiration
I sourced a lot of design inspiration for this website by researching patient portals online and websites for hospitals and GPs. This provided me with a better understanding of the typical user interface for these applications and the type of colour schemes used.

### Colour Scheme
The main base colour chosen for this website (red) was sourced from a patient portal mockup for [Orlando Health](http://struongux.com/ohealth.html). I used Adobe Illustrator's colour picker tools to identify the hexadecimal value for this colour, which was **#9E0035**. I also used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to generate more monochromatic shades from this base colour, which I used on the homepage. The colour blue appears to be very standard across many medical website designs, so it was nice to try out something a little different here.

## Website Structure

### Wireframes

I created wireframes for this web application using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/):

**Desktop wireframes:**

* [Register Wireframe](images/readme/register-desktop-wireframe.png)
* [Sign In Wireframe](images/readme/signin-desktop-wireframe.png)
* [Dashboard Wireframe](images/readme/dashboard-desktop-wireframe.png)
* [Health Profile Wireframe](images/readme/edit-profile-desktop-wireframe.png)
* [Add Log Wireframe](images/readme/add-log-desktop-wireframe.png)

**Mobile Wireframes**

**Tablet Wireframes**

### Mockups
I created some higher fidelity desktop mockups for the key pages on the website. This provided me with an opportunity to sample my chosen colours and ensure the layout I had wireframed looked visually appealing. Please see desktop mockups below:

* [Register Mockup](images/readme/register-mockup.png)
* [Sign In Mockup](images/readme/sign-in-mockup.png)
* [Dashboard Mockup](images/readme/dashboard-mockup.png)
* [Health Profile Mockup](images/readme/health-profile-mockup.png)
* [Add Log Mockup](images/readme/add-log-mockup.png)

### Database Structure

MongoDB was used to set up the database for MediTracker. I used [Canva](www.canva.com) to illustrate the collections, along with their documents, in the image below:

### Sitemap

I also used Canva to design a sitemap for this website as displayed below:
