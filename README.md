Code Institute | Milestone Project 3 | Data Centric Development

## Purpose
### Introduction
With chronic illness prevalence expected to continue rising, it's important that patients are able to monitor their condition(s) and provide their medical team with a clear picture of their disease progression. Furthermore, the disruptions which COVID-19 has brought to the medical setting for many people, makes it easy for new symptoms or disease progression to be missed. To tackle this, MediTracker allows patients who deal with chronic illness to take control of their symptoms by keeping a log of their disease status over time. They can then share this log with their medical team.

### Vision and Mission
MediTracker's Vision is to empower chronic illness patients to take control of their health. MediTracker's Mission is to provide patients with a secure web application which allows them to keep logs of their medical records and report it back to their medical team. 

### Target Audience
The target audience for this web application are inviduals who have chronic illnesses and want to get more from their interactions with their medical team by providing a more accurate  representation of their symptoms over time, rather than recalling from memory.
