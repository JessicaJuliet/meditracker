Code Institute | Milestone Project 3 | Data Centric Development

## Purpose
### Introduction
With chronic illness prevalence expected to continue rising, it's important that patients are able to monitor their condition(s) and provide their medical team with a clear picture of their disease progression. Furthermore, the disruptions which COVID-19 has inflicted upon the medical setting for many people, new symptoms or disease progression may be missed as a result. To tackle this, MediTracker allows patients who deal with chronic illness to take control of their symptoms by keeping a log of their disease status over time. They can then share this log with their medical team.

### Vision and Mission
MediTracker's Vision is to empower chronic illness patients to take control of their health. MediTracker's Mission is to provide patients with a secure application which allows them to keep logs of their medical records and report it back to their medical team.
